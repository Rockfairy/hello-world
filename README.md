# hello-world
lets get started here on Github

I am an media informatic Student just started with school end of Summer 2017. 
In my free time i love to create art. I Signed up here so i can learn how to create things on my own, out of school and improve my skills as a programmer. Mostly i want to become a Webdesigner at the end of my Study, but i am very intrested in different types of programming.
